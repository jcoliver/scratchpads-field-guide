			darker (in both body and appendages) and broader than all other members of subgenus <a class = "term-link" href = "taxonomy/term/5419">
			Liocosmius</a> other than <a class = "term-link" href = "taxonomy/term/5700">B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</a> .  The pronotum is particular 
			is wider than in most other <i>Liocosmius</i>.  In color, the side margins of the elytra are dark brown 
			to black, as is the background color of the pronotum and elytra.  The antennae are dark brown to black, with only the basal 
			three articles being at palest a reddish color.  The femora are dark brown or dark reddish brown in most specimens.  The only 
			species that <i>B. horni</i> is likely to be confused with is <i>B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</i>.  The pale elytral spots are smaller than in most 
			<i>Liocosmius</i>, but not as small as those of <i>B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</i>.  The posterior spots of <i>B. horni</i> are tapered toward the midline, 
			and bent posteriorly, so that they are somewhat comma-shaped, whereas those of <i>B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</i> are blunt medially.  As well, 
			the parascutellar stria of B. horni have distinct punctures that are much more evident than those of <i>B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</i>.  The 
			male genitalia of <i>B. horni</i> has a distinctive ventral bulge, and the flagellum of the internal sac is short, although not as 
			short as <i>B. &quot;SierraStar&quot;</i>.</p>
